#Financial Forecasting with two different datasets
* dow_jones_index: contains several US companies in the dow jones index over two quarters (one for training, one for testing) and with one sample per week.
Furthermore, it contains additional information like volumne and potentially features like percent_change_price, days_to_next_dividend that could affect the accuracy of the prediction.
* stockvalues: contains daily closing prices of 159 stocks on 1813 dates from Jan 3, 2000 to March 30. Here are no additional information provided. 

So, the aim of this program is to evaluate the accuracy of the stock forecasting and search for the best indicators to predict the economy.
